This is a simple real-time chat application created for Task-2 of the CodTech Internship Program. The main goal of this project was to build a chat app where multiple users can send and receive messages instantly.

To make this possible, I used Socket.IO, a JavaScript library that helps with real-time communication. It allows messages to be sent and received immediately between the server and the user's browsers without refreshing the page.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

This chat app is made up of two main parts:

Frontend – This is what the user sees and interacts with (like input boxes, messages, etc.).The frontend of the app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a clean and simple design so that users can easily understand and use it. When someone first opens the app in their browser, they are asked to enter their username. After entering the name, they are taken to the chat screen, where they can start sending and receiving messages in real-time.

Every message sent is displayed with the user’s name. All messages are shown in the order they are sent, making it easy for users to follow the conversation.



Backend – This is the server part that runs in the background. It receives the messages from one user and sends them to all others. The backend of the app is made using Node.js and Express.js. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server, and Express helps in creating a simple and fast server.

The backend listens for messages from users. When a message is received, the server uses Socket.IO to instantly send that message to all users who are currently connected. This way, everyone sees the new message right away without needing to refresh the page.

WORKFLOW:

The user opens the app in their browser.

They are asked to enter their name.

After entering the name, they see a message box.

When they type a message and click "Send", the message is sent to the server.

The server sends that message to all users instantly.

Everyone sees the message appear in the chat window.

CONCLUSION: 

Through this project, I learned how real-time chat systems work. I now understand how to use Socket.IO to send messages instantly and how the frontend and backend can work together using JavaScript. I also learned how to build a simple user interface with HTML and CSS. This project helped me understand full-stack development in a better way, and it gave me more confidence in working on both the client and server sides of a web application.

This project gave me practical experience in building real-time applications and helped me improve both my frontend and backend development skills.
